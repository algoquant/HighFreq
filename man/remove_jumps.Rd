\title{Remove overnight close-to-open price jumps from an \emph{OHLC} time series,
by adding adjustment terms to its prices.}
\usage{
remove_jumps(ohlc)
}
\arguments{
\item{\code{ohlc}}{An \emph{OHLC} time series of prices and trading volumes, in
\emph{xts} format.}
}
\value{
An \emph{OHLC} time series with the same dimensions and the same time
  index as the input \code{ohlc} time series.
}
\description{
Remove overnight close-to-open price jumps from an \emph{OHLC} time series,
by adding adjustment terms to its prices.
}
\details{
The function \code{remove_jumps()} removes the overnight
  close-to-open price jumps from an \emph{OHLC} time series, by adjusting its
  prices so that the first \emph{Open} price of the day is equal to the last
  \emph{Close} price of the previous day.

  The function \code{remove_jumps()} adds adjustment terms to all the
  \emph{OHLC} prices, so that intra-day returns and volatilities are not
  affected.

  The function \code{remove_jumps()} identifies overnight periods as those
  that are greater than 60 seconds. This assumes that intra-day periods
  between neighboring rows of data are 60 seconds or less.

  The time index of the \code{ohlc} time series is assumed to be in
  \emph{POSIXct} format, so that its internal value is equal to the number of
  seconds that have elapsed since the \emph{epoch}.

# Remove overnight close-to-open price jumps from SPY data
