\title{Calculate the volume-weighted average price of an \emph{OHLC} time series
over a rolling look-back interval.}
\usage{
roll_vwap(oh_lc, x_ts = oh_lc[, 4], look_back)
}
\arguments{
\item{oh_lc}{An \emph{OHLC} time series of prices in \emph{xts} format.}

\item{x_ts}{A single-column \emph{xts} time series.}

\item{look_back}{The size of the look-back interval, equal to the number of
rows of data used for calculating the average price.}
}
\value{
An \emph{xts} time series with a single column and the same number of
  rows as the argument \code{oh_lc}.
}
\description{
Performs the same operation as function \code{VWAP()} from package
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TTR/index.html}{VWAP},
but using vectorized functions, so it's a little faster.
}
\details{
The function \code{roll_vwap()} calculates the volume-weighted
  average closing price, defined as the sum of the prices multiplied by
  trading volumes in the look-back interval, divided by the sum of trading
  volumes in the interval. If the argument \code{x_ts} is passed in explicitly,
  then its volume-weighted average value over time is calculated.
}
\examples{
# calculate and plot rolling volume-weighted average closing prices (VWAP)

chart_Series(HighFreq::SPY["2013-11-12"], name="SPY prices")
