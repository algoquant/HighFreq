\description{
Perform a backtest simulation of a trading strategy (model) over a vector of
end points along a time series of prices.
}
\details{
The function \code{roll_backtest()} performs a rolling backtest 
  simulation of a trading strategy over a vector of end points. At each end 
  point, it trains (calibrates) a forecasting model using past data taken 
  from the \code{x_ts} time series over the look-back interval, and applies
  the forecasts to the \code{trade_func()} trading model, using out-of-sample
  future data from the look-forward interval.
  
  The function \code{trade_func()} should simulate the trading model, and it 
  should return a named list with at least two elements: a named vector of 
  performance statistics, and an \emph{xts} time series of out-of-sample 
  returns.  The list returned by \code{trade_func()} can also have additional
  elements, like the in-sample calibrated model statistics, etc.

  The function \code{roll_backtest()} returns a named list containing the
  lists returned by function \code{trade_func()}.  The list names are equal
  to the \emph{end_points} dates. 
  The number of list elements is equal to the number of \emph{end_points}
  minus two (because the first and last end points can't be included in the
  backtest).
