\title{Calculate a time series of \emph{Hurst} exponents over a rolling look-back
interval.}
\usage{
roll_hurst(ohlc, look_back = 11)
}
\arguments{
\item{\code{ohlc}}{An \emph{OHLC} time series of prices in \emph{xts} format.}

\item{\code{look_back}}{The size of the look-back interval, equal to the number of 
rows of data used for aggregating the \emph{OHLC} prices.}
}
\value{
An \emph{xts} time series with a single column and the same number of
  rows as the argument \code{ohlc}.
}
\description{
Calculate a time series of \emph{Hurst} exponents over a rolling look-back
interval.
}
\details{
The function \code{roll_hurst()} calculates a time series of
  \emph{Hurst} exponents from \emph{OHLC} prices, over a rolling look-back
  interval.

  The \emph{Hurst} exponent is defined as the logarithm of the ratio of the
  price range, divided by the standard deviation of returns, and divided by
  the logarithm of the interval length.

  The function \code{roll_hurst()} doesn't use the same definition as the
  rescaled range definition of the \emph{Hurst} exponent.
  First, because the price range is calculated using \emph{High} and
  \emph{Low} prices, which produces bigger range values, and higher
  \emph{Hurst} exponent estimates.
  Second, because the \emph{Hurst} exponent is estimated using a single
  aggregation interval, instead of multiple intervals in the rescaled range
  definition.

  The rationale for using a different definition of the \emph{Hurst} exponent
  is that it's designed to be a technical indicator for use as input into
  trading models, rather than an estimator for statistical analysis.
