\title{Calculate time series of Sharpe-like statistics for each row of a \emph{OHLC}
time series.}
\usage{
run_sharpe(oh_lc, calc_method = "close")
}
\arguments{
\item{oh_lc}{An \emph{OHLC} time series of prices in \emph{xts} format.}

\item{calc_method}{A \emph{character} string representing method for
estimating the Sharpe-like exponent.}
}
\value{
An \emph{xts} time series with the same number of rows as the
  argument \code{oh_lc}.
}
\description{
Calculate time series of Sharpe-like statistics for each row of a \emph{OHLC}
time series.
}
\details{
The function \code{run_sharpe()} calculates Sharpe-like statistics
  for each row of a \emph{OHLC} time series.
  The Sharpe-like statistic is defined as the ratio of the difference between
  \emph{Close} minus \emph{Open} prices divided by the difference between
  \emph{High} minus \emph{Low} prices.
  This statistic may also be interpreted as something like a Hurst exponent
  for a single row of data.
  The motivation for the Sharpe-like statistic is the notion that if prices
  are trending in the same direction inside a given time bar of data, then
  this statistic is close to either 1 or -1.
